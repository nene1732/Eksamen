            <h2>Introduction to Accessibility</h2>
            <p>Accessibility is about ensuring that a website, app, 
                or digital product can be used by everyone, 
                regardless of their abilities. This includes people with, for example, 
                hearing impairments or motor challenges (e.g., those unable to use a mouse or keyboard). </p>

                <p>In web development, accessibility involves using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in a way that makes content understandable, navigable, and interactive for all users. It is important to ensure that websites and apps are user-friendly for everyone, 
                    because it helps expand the audience the website aims to reach and gets to be of use to as many people as possible.</p>

            <h2>Key Accessibility Features</h2>
            <p>For the accessibility of our website, we made thoughtful coding choices to ensure a user-friendly experience for all. 
                We focused on using a clear semantic HTML structure, utilizing relevant heading tags (H1, H2, etc.) 
                to maintain content hierarchy. Links are well-defined to ensure that screen readers can interpret them properly. 
                In addition, interactive elements, such as buttons and form inputs, are fully keyboard navigable, allowing users to 
                interact with them using the tab key. Forms have their proper labelling and error handling, optimized for both 
                screen readers and keyboard navigation, ensuring a smooth user experience for individuals with disabilities. 
                These efforts contribute to a more inclusive website, ensuring that all users can engage with the content effectively. </p>

            The OsloMet MatMod website was the foundation for one of our pages. It was used to develop 
            a more straightforward and accessible page. We used the standard font family in Visual Studio Code simply 
            because of its clean and easy-to-read characteristics, which improved the overall readability of the content.
            The display of program details for example, 
            is simplified and clear to make it easy for the website users to comprehend the content.

            We also have “hidden” links that lead to more information if the user would like to require more relevant information. 
            Such a component aids in making the navigation easier whilst enhancing the user experience. 
            By having information clearly presented, the user is less likely to get frustrated and get the information they are searching for.

            A blue colour scheme was landed on for the Index and Norway page for its aesthetically pleasing visual and also the 
            contrast it gave some of the text. Blue is a universally liked colour, and some studies even suggest that it is a calming
             colour. Making it an ideal choice for creating a positive experience. The choice was not only based on its visual appeal, 
             but also its ability to subconsciously resonate with the users, promoting a sense of reliability and comfort. 
            This subtle influence of colour encourages a longer interaction time, 
            allowing users to explore the site more thoroughly.
