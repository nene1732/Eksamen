        <h2>General Collaboration in Repositories Like GitHub</h2>
        <p>The initial phase of using GitHub and GitHub Desktop was confusing, but it became more intuitive over time. 
            GitHub facilitates collaboration through features like committing, pulling, and pushing. Using GitHub Desktop, 
            we can view the complete history of all changes made in VS Code. 
            This makes it easier to revisit previous work and understand how the project has evolved.
            When collaborating with others, GitHub enables teams to work more efficiently and effectively. 
            The history log helps identify errors that may have been introduced by team members, 
            allowing us to troubleshoot and assist each other. Tools like GitHub, Live Share, 
            and Git also help resolve conflicts and streamline code review, ensuring smoother workflows for everyone involved.</p>

        <h2>Specific Tools and Challenges</h2>
        <p>One of the main challenges with Git was the initial setup. 
            When integrating GitHub into VS Code, we struggled to understand how to push, pull, 
            and commit changes directly within the editor. 
            At first, we could only perform these actions through GitHub Desktop, 
            which was unnecessary but seemed like the only option. 
            Moreover, committing in Desktop was almost impossible, 
            so most of our commits were done in VS Code. 
            This required constant switching between Desktop and VS Code to track updates, which was cumbersome.

            <h4>Some challenges we faced included:</h4>
            
           <p> Misunderstanding how to use branches properly.</p>

            <p>Difficulty with authentication, especially when linking VS Code to GitHub.</p>
            <p>Despite these hurdles, learning to navigate GitHub and its 
            integration with VS Code has been a valuable experience in improving team collaboration.</p>
